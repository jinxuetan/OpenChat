## Key Changes from Previous Schema

1. **Messages now support parts**: While keeping the `content` field for backward compatibility, messages can now have structured `parts` for rich content like images, files, and tool invocations.

2. **Modular structure**: Each entity is now in its own file for better organization and maintainability.

3. **Preserved threading**: The `parentMessageId` field is retained to support message threading.

4. **Chat-based (not thread-based)**: We're keeping the chat paradigm instead of switching to threads, maintaining consistency with the existing application structure.
