## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun (recommended)
- Git
- A Convex account (free tier available)
- API keys for the AI models you want to use

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenChat.git
cd OpenChat

# Install dependencies (using Bun - recommended)
bun install

# Or with npm
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Convex Backend

OpenChat uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) for real-time backend, authentication, and database management.

```bash
# Install Convex CLI globally
bun add -g convex

# Login to Convex (creates account if needed)
bunx convex login

# Set up a new Convex project
bunx convex dev --once
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project in your dashboard
- Generate a `convex/` directory with your schema
- Create a `.env.local` file with your Convex URL

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your API keys to `.env.local`:

```env
# Convex (automatically added by Convex CLI)
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-url

# AI Model API Keys (add the ones you want to use)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-key
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your-together-key

# Secret used to encrypt user-provided API keys
API_KEY_SECRET=change-me

# Authentication (Convex handles this automatically)
CONVEX_AUTH_ADAPTER=convex

# Optional: Web Search API Keys
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-key  # For web search functionality (recommended)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key  # Alternative web search provider
```

`API_KEY_SECRET` is used server-side to encrypt any API keys users save in the
settings page. Keep it long and random.

### 4. Set up Authentication

OpenChat uses Convex Auth for authentication with Google OAuth. Follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google OAuth**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google+ API
   - Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Set application type to "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
     - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

2. **Configure Convex Auth**:
   - Go to your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials:

```env
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # For development
```

3. **Reference**: For detailed setup instructions, see the [Convex Auth Google Provider Documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/config/google)

### 5. Deploy Convex Functions

Deploy your Convex schema and functions:

```bash
# Deploy to Convex (this pushes your functions and schema)
bunx convex deploy

# Or for development with hot reload
bunx convex dev
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
bun dev

# Or with npm
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see OpenChat running locally!

### 7. Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Deploy Convex**:
   ```bash
   bunx convex deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend** (Vercel recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   bun add -g vercel
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Add your production API keys to Vercel
   - Update `SITE_URL` in Convex dashboard to your production URL

### Troubleshooting

**Convex Connection Issues**:
- Ensure you're logged into Convex: `bunx convex login`
- Check your deployment URL in `.env.local`
- Run `bunx convex dev` to sync functions

**Authentication Issues**:
- Verify OAuth credentials in Convex dashboard
- Check `SITE_URL` matches your development/production URL
- Ensure Convex Auth is properly configured

**API Key Issues**:
- Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
- Check API key permissions and quotas
- Some models may require waitlist approval

**Need Help?**
- Check the [Convex Documentation](https://docs.convex.dev)
- Review the [Convex Auth Guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth)
- See [Google OAuth Setup](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/config/google) for authentication
- Get an [Exa API key](https://exa.ai/) for web search functionality
- Open an issue in this repository
