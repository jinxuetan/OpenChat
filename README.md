## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun (recommended)
- Git
- A Convex account (free tier available)
- API keys for the AI models you want to use

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajanraj/OpenChat.git
cd OpenChat

# Install dependencies (using Bun - recommended)
bun install
```

### 2. Set up Convex Backend

OpenChat uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) for real-time backend, authentication, and database management.

```bash
# Install Convex CLI globally
bun add -g convex

# Login to Convex (creates account if needed)
bunx convex login

# Set up a new Convex project (this creates .env.local with Convex URLs)
bunx convex dev --once
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project in your dashboard
- Generate a `convex/` directory with your schema
- Create a `.env.local` file with your Convex deployment URLs

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Important**: Convex creates `.env.local` with deployment URLs. Don't overwrite it!

Instead, copy the example file to see what other variables you need:

```bash
# View the example to see what API keys you need
cat .env.example

# Add the additional variables to your existing .env.local
# (Don't copy over - this would delete your Convex URLs!)
```

Manually add these to your existing `.env.local` file:
- AI model API keys (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, etc.)
- Analytics keys (PostHog, Umami) 
- Search provider keys (Exa)
- Other configuration from `.env.example`

### 4. Set up Authentication

OpenChat uses Convex Auth for authentication with Google OAuth.

1. **Initialize Convex Auth:**
   ```bash
   # Initialize Convex Auth setup
   bunx @convex-dev/auth
   ```

2. **Set up Google OAuth:**
   - Follow the [Google OAuth Setup Guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth/google)
   - Set your Google OAuth credentials in Convex:
   ```bash
   # Set Google OAuth credentials
   bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID your-google-client-id
   bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET your-google-client-secret
   ```

3. **Set Required Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Generate and set API key encryption secret in Convex (REQUIRED)
   bunx convex env set API_KEY_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 64)
   
   # Set site URL for development
   bunx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Optional: Set up Polar Payments:**
   ```bash
   # Set Polar environment variables (optional)
   bunx convex env set POLAR_ORGANIZATION_TOKEN your-polar-organization-token
   bunx convex env set POLAR_PREMIUM_PRODUCT_ID your-product-id
   bunx convex env set POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET your-polar-webhook-secret
   ```

5. **Reference**: For detailed setup instructions, see:
   - [Convex Auth Setup Guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup)
   - [Google OAuth Configuration](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth/google)
   - [Polar Component Documentation](https://www.convex.dev/components/polar)

### 5. Deploy Convex Functions

Deploy your Convex schema and functions:

```bash
# Deploy to Convex (this pushes your functions and schema)
bunx convex deploy

# Or for development with hot reload
bunx convex dev
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see OpenChat running locally!

### 7. Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Deploy Convex**:
   ```bash
   bunx convex deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend** (Vercel recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   bun add -g vercel
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Add your production API keys to Vercel
   - Update `SITE_URL` in Convex production dashboard to your production URL

### Troubleshooting

**Convex Connection Issues**:
- Ensure you're logged into Convex: `bunx convex login`
- Check your deployment URL in `.env.local`
- Run `bunx convex dev` to sync functions

**Authentication Issues**:
- Verify OAuth credentials in Convex dashboard
- Check `SITE_URL` matches your development/production URL
- Ensure Convex Auth is properly configured

**API Key Issues**:
- Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
- Check API key permissions and quotas

**Need Help?**
- Check the [Convex Documentation](https://docs.convex.dev)
- Review the [Convex Auth Setup Guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup)
- See [Google OAuth Configuration](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth/google) for authentication
- Get an [Exa API key](https://exa.ai/) for web search functionality
- Set up [Polar payments](https://www.convex.dev/components/polar) for premium features
- Open an issue in this repository
